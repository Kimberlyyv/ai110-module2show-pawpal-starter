# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

My initial UML design included four main classes: Owner, Pet, Task, and Scheduler. Each class has a specific role in the system.

The Owner class represents the pet owner and stores their pets. It allows the owner to add pets and access tasks for all pets.

The Pet class represents each pet and stores information like the pet’s name and type. It also keeps a list of tasks that belong to that pet.

The Task class represents a single pet care activity, like feeding or walking. It includes details such as the task description, duration, priority, and whether the task has been completed.

The Scheduler class is responsible for organizing tasks and generating a daily plan. It collects tasks from all pets and helps sort or organize them into a schedule.

**b. Design changes**

During implementation, I made a small change to the design. At first, I thought each Pet would handle more of the scheduling logic. Later, I realized it would be better for the Scheduler class to handle organizing tasks for all pets in one place.

This made the system simpler because the Pet class only stores tasks, while the Scheduler focuses on creating the daily schedule.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
